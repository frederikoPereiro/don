# don
shell script for easy work with postgresql and clean system and other...

create folder .don in home/user_name directory -> past these files in the directory -> open .bashrc ("sudo gedit .bashrc")
-> in the end of the .bashrch past " alias don='/home/user_name/.don/don.sh' " -> in the terminal past "source .bashrc"
-> my congratulations! you can call script by command "don" in terminal
